# Black-Scholes-Project
## Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to investigate the accuracy and effectiveness of numerical methods, specifically finite difference methods, in solving the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for option pricing. By comparing the numerical solutions with the exact analytical solution, the project aims to assess the convergence, stability, and computational efficiency of the numerical approach in the context of financial modeling. Additionally, the study seeks to explore the impact of various numerical schemes on the quality of the approximation, including errors due to discretization, and to validate the numerical results by benchmarking them against the exact solution. This comparison will provide insights into the suitability of these methods for real-world financial applications, particularly for option pricing in dynamic markets.
## Conclusions
- The numerical FTCS (Forward Time Central Space) scheme performed reasonably well in approximating the exact Black-Scholes solution for option pricing. The plotted results indicate that the numerical approximation follows the general trend of the exact solution. However, due to the explicit nature of the FTCS method, stability constraints (such as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition) must be carefully considered to prevent divergence, especially for small time steps or large volatility values.

- In the context of financial modeling, numerical approaches like FTCS provide valuable tools for pricing derivative securities when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. They allow for flexibility in handling complex payoffs, varying interest rates, and non-constant volatility models. However, more stable and efficient schemes, such as the Crank-Nicolson method or implicit finite difference methods, are often preferred for practical applications due to their superior stability properties.

- Future improvements could involve exploring more stable numerical techniques and refining discretization parameters to enhance accuracy and computational efficiency.
