# Black-Scholes-Project
## Objective of the project
The objective of this project is to investigate the accuracy and effectiveness of numerical methods, specifically finite difference methods, in solving the Black-Scholes Partial Differential Equation (PDE) for option pricing. By comparing the numerical solutions with the exact analytical solution, the project aims to assess the convergence, stability, and computational efficiency of the numerical approach in the context of financial modeling. Additionally, the study seeks to explore the impact of various numerical schemes on the quality of the approximation, including errors due to discretization, and to validate the numerical results by benchmarking them against the exact solution. This comparison will provide insights into the suitability of these methods for real-world financial applications, particularly for option pricing in dynamic markets.
